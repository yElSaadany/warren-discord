# warren-discord
A Discord bot made for financial, trading and investing servers.

### Usage
Kinda messy right now, DM for details if you want to try it.

### TODO
* Fetch everything from Warren API
* Restructure / Refactor because right now it's a mess
* Better calls for trading hours -> CRON instead of setTimeout
* Update `$help` command
* Generic error message (permissions, wrong command, etc)
* Add stock price fetching
